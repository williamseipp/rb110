# introduction
    make a repo
# collection basics
    * understand how to reference individual elements of a collection
    * #slice(x,y) y is the string LENGTH, not the ending index!
    * to iterate through a hash, you need to iterate through an array
        of its keys
    * #fetch is used because a return value of nil is ambiguous: was
        the index out of bounds or is the element nil? This applies to
        both Arrays and Hashes
    * be aware of the conversion methods between different collections

# looping
    you should be proficient enough to loop through a collection using just
    #loop

# selection and transformation
    * understand if method mutates original collection or returns new one
    * be aware of using parameters, and pay attention to what is returned
