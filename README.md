    lesson 1.1: figure out how to use string, array, and hash methods to select
    data. Be aware that the return value differs wildly.

    lesson 1.2: learn how to manually iterate through data structures with a
    loop. Might be a good idea on implementing each, map, select functionality
    with a simple loop.

    lesson 1.3: PEDAC. Focus on the PDA, what is the problem and what should
    the combo of data structure and algorithm be?
